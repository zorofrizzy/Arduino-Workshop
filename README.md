# Arduino-Workshop
Codes for the students who attended the workshop on\
Basics of electronics and Arduino Interfacing.

This repository contains codes for the students who attended the workshop   
on Basic Electronics and Arduino Interfacing held at ADGITM, New Delhi,  
formerly known as Northern India Engineering College.

# The workshop was held on 3 accounts
1. 8th - 9th October, 2018
2. 3rd - 5th March, 2019
3. 4th - 6th April, 2020

There are pin declarations made in the codes to ease out the connections\
the circuits. However, if a pin is not mentioned (only in the case of Bluetooth)\
then no connection is required on those pins.  

VCC and GND pins are automatically assumed to be connected in all cases.
